# MaxEngineTemplate
This is just a simple set of readymades for MaxMSP
It includes a basic set of sequencers, a working monome subpatcher, an efx switcher, etc. 
It's designed for the total beginner who just wants to assemble something that 'works'-- I leave it to the user to add and modify chunks as needed. 

Now with "AXCL"-- a drum programming/pattern sequencing item for analog RYTM, but can be easily modified for other MIDI controllable drum machines.
